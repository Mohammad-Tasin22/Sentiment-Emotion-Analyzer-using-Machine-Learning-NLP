Features

-Detects emotions from text data.

-Uses Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for feature extraction.

-Implements Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for prediction.

-Can be easily extended to work with chat applications, social media data, or any text input.

-How It Works

Text Preprocessing – Convert text to lowercase, remove unnecessary characters, and clean the data.

Feature Extraction – Transform text into numerical features using:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF

Model Training – Train models to classify emotions using:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Prediction – Input text is converted into features and the trained model predicts the emotion.
